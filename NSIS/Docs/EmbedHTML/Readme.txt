EmbedHTML NSIS plug-in

Author:  Stuart 'Afrow UK' Welch
Date:    2nd November 2015
Version: 1.0.0.3

Embeds an HTML document anywhere in the installer window.

See Examples\EmbedHTML\*

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Internet Explorer IWebBrowser2 control is used to display the HTML
document. By default, the newest installed version of IE will be used
to display the document.

This plug-in is written in C++ and has been statically linked against
its dependent Microsoft Visual C Runtime v110. Therefore you do not need
to distribute MSVCR110.dll in your installer to use this plug-in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible Crash
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not load a web page that uses the setTimeout() JavaScript function.
At time of writing there is an IE bug which causes the installer to
crash if setTimeout() calls a function after the IWebBrowser2 control
has been closed/disposed. An example is the Google homepage.

Functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

EmbedHTML::Load [/replace] [/nomaxem] hwnd path_or_url

Loads the HTML (path_or_url) document over the window with the specified
handle (hwnd).

Optionally specify /replace if you wish the HTML document window to
replace the specified window (thus destroying it).

Optionally specify /nomaxem to disable maximum browser emulation. The
default operating system IE version will be used to display the HTML
instead (typically IE7).

The plug-in handles document unloading and cleanup automatically either
when Next or Back is clicked or when the installer window is closed.

The error flag is set if the document could not be loaded.
