Internet Explorer Functions:
----------------------------

This plugin implements a few functions that can be used to control Internet Explorer. 
I created this to have the ability to activate plugin toolbars for Internet Explorer, 
so those are all the functions I implemented.

There are two versions of the dll, both work exactly de same, but IEFunctionsDbg.dll displays 
a couple of messageboxes when error's occur. This also means it is 1.5K bigger, so for those
who think that size does matter, I've included the 3.5K dll that does not display these messages.
(In the source, this can be easily turned on and off by defining _NO_ERROR_MESSAGES)

It has the following functions:

OpenBrowser
CloseBrowser
ReleaseBrowser
SurfTo
ShowBar

You start using it by calling OpenBrowser and finish by calling CloseBrowser or ReleaseBrowser.
While you're using it, call all function with the /NOUNLOAD flag or you'll have memory leaks
(besides, the call won't work, because the pointer to the browser hasn't been remembered from OpenBrowser)

This DLL makes use of the IWebBrowser2 interface, if you want to have extra functions, go look in
MSDN and add them.



Function Descriptions:

OpenBrowser:
------------
This opens a new internet explorer. After you're done with the browser, call CloseBrowser or ReleaseBrowser.
This function must be called first, before any of the other functions can be called.

Usage: 'IEFunctions::OpenBrowser /NOUNLOAD'

Restrictions: The dll can only make a single connection to a browser, so OpenBrowser can only be called
			  once or after CloaseBrowser or ReleaseBrowser has been called.

CloseBrowser:
-------------
Closes the opened browser window and releases the stored interface to it. After this call no other functions 
can be called on the browser again, save OpenBrowser.

Usage: ''IEFunctions::CloseBrowser'

Restrictions: OpenBrowser must have been called first

ReleaseBrowser:
---------------
Release the stored interface to opened browser window. The dll closes it connection to the browser and
leaves it open. After this call no other functions can be called on the browser again, 
save OpenBrowser.

Usage: ''IEFunctions::ReleaseBrowser'

Restrictions: OpenBrowser must have been called first

SurfTo:
--------
Makes the browser navigate to the specified url.

Usage: ''IEFunctions::SurfTo /NOUNLOAD "http://www.url.com"'

Restrictions: OpenBrowser must have been called first.


ShowBar:
--------
Makes a toolbar in internet explorer visible.

Usage: ''IEFunctions::ShowBar /NOUNLOAD "<CLSID>"'

Restrictions: OpenBrowser must have been called first.

Note: <CLSID> is in the format of a registry GUID: {91766D08-CF68-4F23-94C4-C1468FDE68AA}
