Metadl - metalink downloading plugin for NSIS
Copyright (c) 2007 Hampus Wessman (hw@vox.nu)

This plugin is partly based on the NSISdl plugin's source code
and also uses libcurl, Expat and some code from XySSL.

The Metadl plugin is licensed under GNU LGPL (see lgpl.txt).

The code that comes from NSISdl was originally licensed under
another license and that license is included in NSISdl.txt.
That license needs to be included in any source distribution
that contains any of the NSISdl code.
Note that some of the code from NSISdl has been modified.
