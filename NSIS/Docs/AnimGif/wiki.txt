== Description ==

AnimGif.dll is NSIS plug-in, displaying animated banner on the installer page. Based on the Juan Soulie code. Unfortunately base program fails on some images (very seldom), this case you can use AnimGifPe.zip variant based on the Oleg Bykov' PictureEx sample, which also supports static BMP and JPEG, but unpacks image very slowly. Plug-in not stops installer execution when banner is displayed. Banner is not clickable. May be used in the page custom show/leave functions and on other (not page) windows with possible trasparency limitations.

== Command line (NSIS script) ==

Plug-in DLL functions (entry points): play, stop
